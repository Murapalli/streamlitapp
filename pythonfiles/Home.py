st.write("""The Instant Coffee Market size is estimated at USD 33.18 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 43.54 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 5.58% during the forecast period (2024-2029).
              "    "Convenience is the foremost factor driving the demand for instant coffee that can be easily prepared. Moreover, the rising popularity of ready-to-eat products, especially among the working population and students, represents another significant factor impelling the market growth. Additionally, the wide availability of instant coffee, per different consumer tastes and preferences, through a wide range of distribution channels supports market growth. Moreover, the increased focus on unique, authentic flavors and functional properties of coffee has aided in the premiumization of instant coffee. Multinational players and local craft brands emphasize designing authentic flavors to cater to the diversified demands of consumers. For instance, in September 2023, the Devon-based company Littleâ€™s launched a new Toffee Nut Instant Coffee made using premium beans that are roasted and freeze-dried. Additionally, the company launched its instant coffee products in different flavors ranging from Rich Hazelnut and French Vanilla to spiced Cardamom Bun and Christmas Spirit. Such innovations, coupled with advancements in packaging types, such as sachets catering to single-time users, are expected to further boost the sales of instant coffee products across the globe.""")
